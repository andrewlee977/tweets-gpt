# twitter-gpt

Project scrapes tweets from a twitter account and creates vector embeddings for each tweet before inserting into langchain vector DB. This process all happens in a separate ipynb notebook not uploaded to this repo

The app portion takes a question and is able to answer questions in natural language based on those tweets only.

Answers could improve by indexing more tweets from different accounts, but keeping it limited to one account, for now ;)
